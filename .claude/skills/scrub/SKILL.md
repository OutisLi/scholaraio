# Scrub Metadata

Use this skill when the library contains already-ingested papers whose metadata is still clearly low quality after ingest or enrich, especially for non-standard documents that MinerU or fallback parsers converted successfully but described poorly.

`scrub` is a review-and-repair workflow, not a blind batch rewrite. It should reuse existing ScholarAIO repair and rename primitives, and it should treat `.scrubbed` as the durable marker for "reviewed and currently acceptable."

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- clean bad metadata after enrich
- repair placeholder or garbled titles
- fix suspicious author names
- fill in missing years when the paper content supports it
- incrementally review a large library without reprocessing already-reviewed papers

Do not use this skill for:

- normal ingest
- DOI or citation-count refresh
- paper-content enrichment such as TOC/L3 extraction
- directory normalization when metadata is already trustworthy and `rename` alone is enough

## Workflow

### 1. Find unreviewed candidates

Skip papers that already contain `.scrubbed`.

You can list suspicious, unreviewed papers with a Python helper that resolves `papers_dir` from the active ScholarAIO config:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from scholaraio.audit import list_scrub_suspects
from scholaraio.config import load_config

cfg = load_config()

for issue in list_scrub_suspects(cfg.papers_dir):
    print(f"{issue.paper_id}\t{issue.rule}\t{issue.message}")
PY
```

If the user asked for a broad quality pass, it is also reasonable to start with:

```bash
scholaraio audit
```

Then narrow to papers that are both:

- not already `.scrubbed`
- obviously bad enough to justify manual review

### 2. Inspect one paper at a time

For each candidate, inspect:

```bash
scholaraio show "<paper-id>" --layer 1
```

Then read the source text as needed:

```bash
scholaraio show "<paper-id>" --layer 4
```

If the default view is too long, resolve the actual `paper.md` path from config first and then inspect only the needed slice:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from scholaraio.config import load_config

paper_id = "<paper-id>"
cfg = load_config()
print((cfg.papers_dir / paper_id / "paper.md").resolve())
PY
```

If the head of the file is insufficient, inspect a larger section or search relevant phrases in the resolved `paper.md`.

Focus on extracting only the identity-critical metadata needed to make the paper usable:

- real title or at least a concise, accurate keyword title
- real first author or organization when clearly stated
- publication year when clearly supported by the document

### 3. Repair conservatively

Use `repair` to update only the fields you can support from the source:

```bash
scholaraio repair "<paper-id>" --title "Correct Title" --author "First Author" --year 2024 --dry-run
```

Then run the real repair:

```bash
scholaraio repair "<paper-id>" --title "Correct Title" --author "First Author" --year 2024
```

Use `--no-api` only when API enrichment would be misleading or unnecessary.

Decision policy:

- Title quality is the top priority.
- Authors and year should be repaired when evidence is strong.
- Do not fabricate DOI, journal, or venue.
- If author or year cannot be confirmed reliably, leave them unresolved rather than guessing.

### 4. Handle directory renames correctly

`scholaraio repair` already rewrites `meta.json` and renames the paper directory immediately when title, author, or year changes.

That means the original `<paper-id>` may stop existing right after the real repair. Before marking the paper, resolve the current paper id from the updated metadata:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import json
from scholaraio.config import load_config
from scholaraio.papers import iter_paper_dirs

title = "Correct Title"
cfg = load_config()

for pdir in iter_paper_dirs(cfg.papers_dir):
    meta_path = pdir / "meta.json"
    if not meta_path.exists():
        continue
    meta = json.loads(meta_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
    if meta.get("title") == title:
        print(pdir.name)
        break
else:
    raise SystemExit(f"could not resolve paper id for title: {title}")
PY
```

If you repaired several papers, or edited `meta.json` outside `repair`, normalize names once at the end:

```bash
scholaraio rename --all
```

Because rename may change the directory path, always create the marker using the post-rename directory name.

### 5. Mark reviewed papers

Once a paper has been reviewed and is acceptable for current library use, create the marker:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from scholaraio.config import load_config
from scholaraio.papers import mark_scrubbed

paper_id = "<Author-Year-Title>"
cfg = load_config()
mark_scrubbed(cfg.papers_dir / paper_id)
print(f"marked {paper_id} as scrubbed")
PY
```

Only mark a paper when:

- you have reviewed the record
- the remaining metadata quality is acceptable
- there is no known blocking issue that should force future re-review

`.scrubbed` means reviewed, not perfect.

### 6. Rebuild indexes once per batch

After finishing the batch:

```bash
scholaraio pipeline reindex
```

This keeps search and registry state aligned with renamed or repaired records.

## Heuristics

The most common scrub targets are:

- placeholder titles such as `Introduction`, `TLDR`, `Overview`, `Summary`
- garbled titles containing replacement characters like `�`
- missing or suspicious author names such as `Unknown`
- missing years or placeholder-style directory names like `XXXX`
- malformed directory names created from bad metadata

These are candidate heuristics, not auto-rewrite authority. The paper content is the final source of truth.

## Acceptance Standard

A scrubbed paper should be:

- identifiable in the library
- searchable by a meaningful title
- attributed to a plausible first author or organization when known
- assigned a real year when known
- normalized into the standard directory naming scheme

If you cannot achieve that threshold from the source text, stop short of marking the paper and report the ambiguity to the user.
